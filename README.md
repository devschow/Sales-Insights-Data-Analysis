Star Schema:
![Data Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devschow/Sales-Insights-Data-Analysis/main/Data_Model.jpg)

Main table: 
- sales transactions 

TABLES CONNECTED
- sales customers > connected by ‚Äúcustomer_code‚Äù column;
- sales date> connected by ‚Äúdate‚Äù column;
- sales products > connected by ‚Äúproduct_code‚Äù column;
- sales markets > connected by ‚Äúmarket_code‚Äù column.

Measures created: 
- ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù and ‚ÄúSales Qty‚Äù measures to get the sum of each column instantly in the dashboard.
- "Revenue LY" mesures the revenue generated last year 

# 1) Data Analysis Using SQL:

- The dataset was examined using MySQL to unlock any trends, features, or other potential areas of interest.
- This method is intended to help generate a broader picture rather than show every piece of information that a dataset contains.

## Show all customer records

SELECT * FROM customers;

## Show total number of customers

SELECT count(*) FROM customers;

## Show transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark001)

SELECT * FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';

## Show distrinct product codes that were sold in chennai

SELECT distinct product_code FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';

## Show transactions where currency is US dollars

SELECT * from transactions where currency="USD"

## Show transactions in 2020 join by date table

SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020;

## Show total revenue in year 2020,

SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r";

## Show total revenue in year 2020, January Month,

SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date 
where date.year=2020 and and date.month_name="January" and (transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r");

## Show total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai

SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.market_code="Mark001";

# 2) Data Analysis Using Power BI:

## Formula to create norm_amount column:

= Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] ="USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*82 else [sales_amount], type any)

## Data Visualization üñº
